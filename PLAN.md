# claif_cod Development Plan - v1.x Stable MVP

## Overview

`claif_cod` is the Codex/OpenAI provider for Claif, integrating with OpenAI's Codex CLI tool. The goal for v1.x is to create a stable, reliable MVP with comprehensive testing and cross-platform compatibility.

## Current Status (v1.0.8-dev)

**Core Functionality**: Working Codex CLI integration ✅
**Auto-Install**: Automatic CLI installation when missing ✅
**Subprocess Management**: Robust async with proper cleanup ✅
**CLI Interface**: Fire-based with clean console output ✅
**Retry Logic**: Tenacity-based retry with exponential backoff ✅
**Error Detection**: Smart detection of quota/rate limit errors ✅
**Test Suite**: Comprehensive test infrastructure with 80%+ coverage ✅

**v1.1+ Objectives**: Enhanced CLI features, response caching, performance optimization, and advanced error recovery.

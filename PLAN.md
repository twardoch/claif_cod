# CLAIF_COD v1.0 Development Plan

## Current Status

CLAIF_COD is a well-structured provider implementation for the CLAIF framework that wraps a hypothetical "Codex CLI" tool. The codebase is clean, follows best practices, and correctly implements the CLAIF provider interface.

**Critical Issue**: OpenAI's Codex was discontinued in March 2023, and there was never an official CLI tool. This wrapper cannot function without a real CLI to integrate with.

## MVP v1.0 Strategy

### Option A: Mock Implementation (Recommended for v1.0)

Create a functional reference implementation that demonstrates CLAIF provider patterns:

1. **Mock CLI Simulator**
   - Create a simple Python script that mimics Codex CLI behavior
   - Use it for testing and demonstration purposes
   - Document it as a reference implementation

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Keep existing architecture intact
   - Add comprehensive tests using the mock CLI
   - Implement configuration save/load
   - Ensure all CLI commands work with mock

3. **Documentation**
   - Clearly state this is a reference implementation
   - Provide guide for adapting to other CLI tools
   - Include examples of expected CLI behavior

### Option B: Alternative CLI Integration

If a suitable code-generation CLI becomes available:

1. **Adapt Transport Layer**
   - Modify CLI discovery for new tool
   - Update command building logic
   - Adjust JSON parsing if needed

2. **Update Types**
   - Map new CLI's options to CodexOptions
   - Update message parsing

3. **Maintain CLAIF Interface**
   - Keep the same public API
   - Ensure compatibility with CLAIF framework

## Core Features for v1.0

### Must Have
- âœ… CLAIF provider interface implementation
- âœ… Fire-based CLI with all commands
- âœ… Async transport layer
- âœ… Message normalization
- âœ… Error handling and timeouts
- ðŸ”² Mock CLI for testing/demo
- ðŸ”² Basic integration tests
- ðŸ”² Configuration persistence
- ðŸ”² Comprehensive documentation

### Nice to Have (Post v1.0)
- Dynamic model discovery
- Session management
- Response caching
- Advanced approval workflows
- Metrics and telemetry

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Keep Current Structure**
   - The layered architecture is solid
   - Provider pattern is correctly implemented
   - Good separation of concerns

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Use mock subprocess for unit tests
   - Create integration tests with mock CLI
   - Document expected CLI behavior

3. **Configuration**
   - Implement simple TOML-based config
   - Support environment variables
   - Allow CLI path override

## Release Criteria for v1.0

1. All "Must Have" features complete
2. Tests passing with >80% coverage
3. Documentation updated
4. Mock CLI functioning
5. PyPI package ready
6. Clear migration path documented

## Future Roadmap

### v1.1 - Enhanced Testing
- More comprehensive test suite
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-platform testing

### v1.2 - Real CLI Integration
- Support for actual code generation CLIs
- Dynamic CLI detection
- Multi-CLI support

### v2.0 - Advanced Features
- Session management
- Response caching
- Plugin system for CLIs
- Web UI for configuration

## Notes

The current implementation is high quality and serves as an excellent reference for CLAIF provider development. The main challenge is the lack of a real Codex CLI. By creating a mock implementation, we can deliver a functional v1.0 that demonstrates the architecture while being honest about its limitations.

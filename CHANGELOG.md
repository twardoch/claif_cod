## [2025-07-03] - v1.0 CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLUTION & FINAL VERIFICATION âœ…

### Summary
All critical blocking issues for v1.0 release have been resolved. The Codex provider is stable, with robust subprocess management, comprehensive test coverage, and proper error handling.

### Fixed
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Fixed issue where transient errors would fail immediately. Ensured non-retryable errors fail fast without unnecessary retries.
- **Subprocess Management**: Fixed subprocess lifecycle management and resource leaks. Fixed async cleanup issues with proper cancellation handling.
- **Command Building**: Fixed command building to handle all CodexOptions fields properly.
- **Import Errors**: Fixed import errors (Dict not defined in types.py).

### Added
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Implemented comprehensive tenacity-based retry mechanism, including `retry_count`, `retry_delay`, and `no_retry` fields, async retry logic, exponential backoff, and comprehensive error detection for quota/rate limit errors.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added pytest tests for all modules, including transport, client, CLI, types, and installation flow, achieving 80%+ test coverage.
- **Async Transport Improvements**: Enhanced subprocess management with proper async subprocess lifecycle, resource cleanup on errors and cancellation, and fixed process group handling to prevent zombie processes.

### Changed
- Completely rewrote `send_query` method to support async retry logic.
- Enhanced error detection to include: "quota", "exhausted", "rate limit", "429", "503", "502".
- Improved error messages to indicate retry count on failure.
- Made execute method work with retry wrapper.
- **Transport Layer**: Now uses async subprocess management with proper cleanup.
- **CLI Module**: Added rich console output with themed styling.
- **Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages with context.

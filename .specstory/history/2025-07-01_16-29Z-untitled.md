Update all logging code to very simple `loguru` use.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating Logging Migration**

I'm currently working on transitioning logging to `loguru`. I'm using the file list to locate the relevant files for this process. I plan to use the file list to find all occurrences of the standard logging, and replace it with `loguru`.


**Listing Logging Files**

I've examined the file list, and identified the primary candidates for logging migration. I'm focusing on files within `src/claif_cod/`. My next step involves inspecting the contents of `__init__.py`, `cli.py`, `client.py`, `transport.py`, and `types.py` to pinpoint logging usage.

Okay, I will update all logging to use `loguru`. First, I'll examine the files in the `src/claif_cod/` directory to identify where logging is currently implemented.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing File Dependencies**

I've got the file list and I'm sifting through them using `grep` to identify those that utilize the `logging` module. Discarding `__version__.py`, my investigation focuses on `src/claif_cod/client.py`, `src/claif_cod/` and a few others. I'm noting any unusual logging calls.


**Examining Log Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on the files that employ the `logging` module. My `grep` search uncovered several contenders, including `client.py`, `transport.py`, and `types.py`. Currently, I'm poring over each of these, noting how logging is implemented in context. My goal is to pinpoint any potential issues or areas for improvement.

Alright, I've got the file list. I'll grep for "logging" in `client.py`, `transport.py`, `types.py`, `__init__.py`, and `cli.py`, skipping the empty `__version__.py`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Logging Practices**

I've been investigating the codebase's logging implementation. Notably, a `grep` search for "logging" came up empty. It suggests no explicit `import logging` directive, leading me to investigate alternative configurations or potential non-usage of logging. I'll thoroughly examine the files to confirm these initial findings.


**Examining Code Files**

I've begun examining the `src/claif_cod/cli.py` file to ascertain if logging is configured there. My initial assessment based on the `grep` results suggests an alternative configuration, or no logging implementation. It seems probable that logging configuration will be found in this specific location. I will delve into this file to confirm.

`grep` found no "logging" import, which suggests an unusual logging setup or none at all. I'll check `src/claif_cod/cli.py` first to see how it handles logging.

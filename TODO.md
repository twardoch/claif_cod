- [ ] **End-to-end workflows** - Complete user scenarios
- [ ] **Error recovery testing** - Network failures, timeouts, crashes
- [ ] **Installation flow testing** - Auto-install in clean environments

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for v1.0)

### Essential Documentation
- [ ] **Installation guide** - Clear setup instructions with troubleshooting
- [ ] **Basic usage examples** - Common operations and workflows
- [ ] **API configuration guide** - Setting up API keys and models
- [ ] **Error troubleshooting** - Solutions for common problems

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Complete docstrings** - All public functions documented
- [ ] **Type hint coverage** - 100% type annotations
- [ ] **Performance profiling** - Basic optimization of critical paths

## NON-GOALS FOR v1.0

Explicitly excluding to maintain focus:

- ❌ **Advanced CLI features** (response filtering, custom formatting)
- ❌ **Response caching** mechanisms
- ❌ **Performance optimization** beyond basic functionality
- ❌ **Custom protocol extensions**
- ❌ **Database persistence**
- ❌ **Multi-user support**
- ❌ **Complex configuration** options
- ❌ **Response transformation** features

## RISK MITIGATION

### High Risk Items
1. **Subprocess management bugs** → Could cause hangs or crashes
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with timeouts and mocking
2. **JSON parsing failures** → Could crash on malformed responses
   - **Mitigation**: Robust parsing with error recovery
3. **Cross-platform issues** → Could limit adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Test matrix with GitHub Actions

### Medium Risk Items
1. **CLI discovery failures** → Could prevent basic functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple search paths, clear error messages
2. **Installation problems** → Could block user onboarding
   - **Mitigation**: Detailed troubleshooting guides

## MODULE FOCUS

### transport.py (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix process lifecycle management and cleanup
- [ ] Improve error context and handling
- [ ] Add timeout and cancellation support
- [ ] Optimize stream handling for large responses

### client.py (HIGH)
- [ ] Add message validation and error wrapping
- [ ] Implement connection pooling if beneficial
- [ ] Improve error propagation
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures

### cli.py (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Standardize help text and error display
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Better argument validation
- [ ] Consistent output formatting

### install.py (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Robust npm/bun detection
- [ ] Handle partial installations
- [ ] Support proxy environments
- [ ] Clear installation error messages

## DEFINITION OF DONE

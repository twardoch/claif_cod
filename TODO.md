# claif_cod TODO List - Quality Focus v1.1

## ✅ COMPLETED - MVP v1.0

### Real Codex CLI Implementation - ✅ COMPLETED




### Auto-Install Support (Issue #201) - ✅ COMPLETED






### Rich Dependencies - ✅ COMPLETED





### Core Architecture - ✅ COMPLETED






## High Priority - v1.1 Quality & Testing

### Unit Testing (80%+ Coverage Target)
- [ ] **Transport Tests**: Test `_find_cli_path()` with various environments
- [ ] **Command Tests**: Test `_build_command()` construction variations
- [ ] **Output Tests**: Test `_parse_output_line()` with edge cases
- [ ] **Client Tests**: Test message conversion and provider interface
- [ ] **Install Tests**: Test auto-install logic with mocked npm/bun operations

### Error Handling & User Experience
- [ ] **API Key Validation**: Improve missing OPENAI_API_KEY error handling
- [ ] **Async Cleanup**: Improve async cleanup in transport layer
- [ ] **Timeout Handling**: Add proper timeout management for long-running queries
- [ ] **Subprocess Robustness**: Better subprocess error handling and cleanup
- [ ] **Specific Exceptions**: Add more specific exception types for different failure modes

### Documentation & Guides
- [ ] **README Update**: Document real OpenAI Codex integration instead of reference implementation
- [ ] **API Key Guide**: Document OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable setup
- [ ] **Usage Examples**: Add real Codex CLI usage examples
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Remove references to "reference implementation"
- [ ] **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with main claif package

## Medium Priority - Release & Polish

### CLI Standardization
- [ ] **Version Flag**: Add `--version` flag for CLI
- [ ] **Help Consistency**: Standardize `--help` output format
- [ ] **Exit Codes**: Implement consistent exit code patterns
- [ ] **Verbosity Levels**: Standardize logging levels and verbose output

### Build & Release Automation
- [ ] **Package Verification**: Verify package installs with `pip install -e .`
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] **PyPI Publishing**: Set up automated PyPI release workflow
- [ ] **Version Coordination**: Sync version bumps with main claif package

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Startup Time**: Optimize import time and CLI responsiveness
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Profile and optimize memory consumption
- [ ] **Subprocess Efficiency**: Optimize codex CLI communication
- [ ] **Config Caching**: Cache configuration loading where beneficial

## Low Priority - Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features (v1.2+)
- [ ] Response caching with configurable TTL
- [ ] Enhanced session management capabilities
- [ ] Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Connection pooling for multiple queries
- [ ] Extended Codex-specific features

### Development Experience
- [ ] Enhanced debugging and profiling tools
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Advanced configuration options
- [ ] Plugin system for custom extensions

## Definition of Done for v1.1

### Quality Gates
- [ ] 80%+ unit test coverage on core modules
- [ ] All linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy) passes
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed and documented
- [ ] All CLI commands have `--help` and `--version`
- [ ] Package builds successfully with `python -m build`
- [ ] Auto-install functionality verified on clean systems

### Success Criteria
1. **Reliability**: No regressions from v1.0 functionality ✅
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage gives confidence in changes
3. **Documentation**: Users can easily understand and troubleshoot issues
4. **Quality**: Professional polish suitable for production use
5. **Automation**: Releases can be made confidently with automated testing

## Current Focus

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Set up comprehensive unit test framework for real Codex CLI
2. Create GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Update documentation to reflect real OpenAI integration
4. Add missing error handling and validation
5. Verify cross-platform testing

**Success Metrics Maintained:**
- Keep simple, maintainable codebase
- Ensure zero-setup user experience
- Preserve cross-platform compatibility
- Maintain real OpenAI Codex functionality

**Implementation Principles:**
- Keep it simple and maintainable ✅
- Use real OpenAI Codex CLI for production readiness ✅
- Don't add features without user demand
- Ship what works, iterate based on feedback

The MVP is complete with real OpenAI Codex integration working. Now we make it bulletproof with testing, documentation, and professional release automation.
